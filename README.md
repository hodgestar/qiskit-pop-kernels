# Understanding and Improving Qubit Measurement

Qubit measurement is a process that consists of generating a measurement
pulse, having the pulse interact with the qubit, reading out voltages,
integrating the voltages into IQ values, and classifying the IQ values
as a particular measurement outcome.

The goal of this project is to understand and characterise this pipeline.
